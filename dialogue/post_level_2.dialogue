You arrived at your next destination, an abandoned city.

Bricks falling out of place, fences cut, and absolutely nobody in sight.

In this desolate landscape, you reminisce.

This is the city named affectionately for you when you were still an entertainer.

You were worshipped as a goddess.

...

...

You miss those days.
